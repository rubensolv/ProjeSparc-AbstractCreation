# ProjeSparc
Sparcraft Project

To use the GAB and SAB, the AI's described in the article (Asymmetric Action Abstractions
for Multi-Unit Control in Adversarial Real-Time Scenarios) I clone this repository and follow the steps of the standard Sparcraft installation.

The standard Sparcraft installation can be found in the repository: https://github.com/davechurchill/ualbertabot.
The Installation Wiki can be found at https://github.com/davechurchill/ualbertabot/wiki/SparCraft-Installation-Instructions.

To test the IA's GAB and SAB you can use the sample_exp_linux.txt, already correctly configured, in the sample_experiment folder.
Just run the following command line (linux) from the cloned folder:

./SparCraft ../sample_experiment/sample_exp_linux.txt
